For cardio goals, it's essential to focus on low-to-moderate intensity exercises, so we recommend incorporating activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming into your routine.

Physical Activity Recommendations: Engage in moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for at least 150 minutes per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Include strength training exercises 2-3 times a week, focusing on lower-body exercises like squats, lunges, and leg press.

Workout Routine Notes: As a cardio-focused workout plan, aim for 30-45 minutes of steady-state cardio per session, 3-4 times a week. For strength training, prioritize exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. For example, try compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press. Don't forget to warm up before each workout and cool down afterwards to prevent injury and promote recovery.

Dietary Restrictions: This meal plan is suitable for individuals with vegetarian dietary preferences and those who are moderately active. However, please consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to ensure this meal plan aligns with your specific health needs and goals.
